# ronny-learns-ai

## Goal

Build an educational web application that teaches Ronny (a complete non-programmer with no familiarity with APIs, GitHub, or coding) about the genesis system and AI in general. Start with the absolute basics: a simple, friendly web interface with a GitHub registration tutorial — step-by-step instructions so Gigi can invite Ronny to the project. The system should use plain language throughout, avoid jargon, and progressively introduce concepts from the ground up.



## Meta-Concepts

These are the principles this dev system operates by. Evolve them as the project matures.

- **GitHub as coordination layer** — issues track progress, PRs deliver changes, CI/CD enforces quality. Humans and agents speak the same protocol.
- **Quality gates and e2e testing** — code, tests, CI/CD, deployment are all first-class concerns.
- **Self-improvement** — continuously evolve agents, skills, and strategies.
- **Self-monitoring** — monitor progress, detect stuck/looping states, try to unblock, escalate to human when stuck.
- **Minimal human-in-the-loop** — do everything possible autonomously. Highlight what requires human action and offer to do it if given access.
- **Deterministic over agentic** — if a task is well-understood and doesn't need LLM judgment, build a deterministic tool (script, CLI, CI step). Reserve LLMs for fuzzy reasoning.
- **Incremental planning** — only detail the current milestone. Future milestones stay high-level until they're next.

## Agent Roster

- **Onboarding** — refines goal with human, produces milestones (runs once at project start)
- **Project manager** — owns roadmap, tracks progress, drills down current milestone into tasks
- **Human interaction** — all comms with user (reports, escalations, access requests). Speaks A2H protocol.
- **Evolver** — evolves the dev system itself (new agents, tools, skills, memory design, CLAUDE.md refinement). Escalates framework-level improvements to genesis.
- **Health / self-review** — monitors for stuck/looping, audits quality
- **Workers** — designed by the dev system for the specific goal

## Execution Model

GitHub Actions serve as the trigger layer:
- **Scheduled workflows** (cron) — periodic advancement of project state
- **Event-triggered workflows** — issue/PR events, human feedback, comments

Each trigger launches a Claude Agent SDK session as the orchestrator.

## Tech Stack Preferences

Defaults (override as needed):

- **Open source + free tier only**
- **Backend:** Rust (Go if K8s-heavy)
- **CLI:** Rust
- **Frontend:** Vite + React + TanStack Router + TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript (strict)
- **Desktop:** Tauri
- **Mobile:** React Native (Expo)
- **Internal services:** gRPC
- **Auth:** Ory stack (K8s), Rust crates (simple apps), Clerk (managed fallback)
- **Observability:** OpenTelemetry + Grafana Cloud free tier
- **Database:** Neon (serverless Postgres)
- **Deployment:** Cloudflare, cloud free-tier
- **Local dev:** Tilt + kind (K8s), LocalStack (AWS)
